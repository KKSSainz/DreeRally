# DreeRally
Death Rally engine reimplementation

See details and status in www.dreerally.com

At this moment there is only certain tools to decrypt the original files:
    
- Bpadecryptor.py: allows to extract the contents of BPA files
- Music.py: once music.bpk file is extracted, with this script you can decrypt the music files and play with VLC.
- SavegameDecrypt.py: takes a savegame and decrypts its contents. A tthis moment it's very easy to modify your savegame :)
- SavegameCrypt.py: takes a decrypted savegame and returns it to the original format. The original death rally must open this file :)
- Bpkdecryptor.py: takes a BPK file and his Pal file to generate a gif file.
